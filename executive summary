Executive Summary of Titanic Analysis:

To predict the binary classification value of survival for the given Titanic Dataset I took
into account the Age of passengers, the paid Fare value, sex, the number of children or parents,
and the Class of the ship the passenger was on.  My model with relatively successful at predicting
these values in a Logistic regression with train/test/split as well as Cross-Validatation.  The Logistic
regression performed slightly better than a K-Nearest Neighbors Classification, which I believe was due to
the numerical values of age & Fare being a better predictor for survival than others (especially as the
passenger class is largely a proxy value for Fare).

Overall, the model could certainly be improved through using more of the available data points, as well as
segmenting passengers from crew members of the ship.  I also dropped the cabin value from my analysis, but
I believe that using a more advanced modeling technique would allow me to successfully use this information.
